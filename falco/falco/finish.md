In this course, you experimented with the basics of Falco and its operation on Docker-based deployments. Starting off from kernel system calls and events, Linux namespaces and container-specific metadata you can configure security alerts without ever having to modify or instrument the Docker images.

This time we just used a simple file output in order to focus on the rule syntax, but you can also [configure a custom programmatic output](https://falco.org/docs/alerts/#program-output) to send notifications to event and alerting systems in your organization.
