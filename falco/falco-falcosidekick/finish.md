In this course you experimented with Falco Response Engine. You learned how to deploy playbooks that respond automatically to a certain security threat taking appropriate actions.

With this really simple example, we only scratched the surface of possibilities, everything is possible now, so don't hesitate to share with us on Slack (https://kubernetes.slack.com #falco) your comments, ideas and successes. You're also always welcome to [contribute](https://github.com/falcosecurity/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Bonus: You're running Falcosidekick outside Kubernetes but still want to use the Kubeless output? No problem, you can declare a kubeconfig file to use. See [README](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcosidekick/blob/master/README.md).
