In this course you experimented with the basics of Sysdig Falco and its operation on a Kubernetes cluster. You learned how to trigger alerts using Kubernetes-specific metadata.

This time you just used a simple file output, but you can also [configure a custom programmatic output](https://github.com/draios/falco/wiki/Falco-Alerts#program-output) to send notifications to event and alerting systems in your organization.
